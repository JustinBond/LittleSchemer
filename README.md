# The Little Schemer (in Javascript)

Inspired by Douglass Crockford's [The Little Javascripter](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/little.html), this is The Little Schemer implemented in Javascript.

One advantage over Crockford's similar work is that I build up step-by-step to the Y combinator, which could be helpful for people trying to understand how the Y combinator works.

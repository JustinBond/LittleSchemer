# The Little Schemer (in Javascript)

Inspired by Douglass Crockford's [The Little Javascripter](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/little.html), this is The Little Schemer implemented in Javascript.

One advantage over Crockford's similar work is that this builds up step-by-step to the Y combinator, which could be helpful for people trying to understand how the Y combinator works.

This is not idiomatic Javascript! Instead it is attempting to emulate LISP as closely as possible, so it makes heavy reliance on expressions and the ternary operator to simulate LISP's cond operator.
